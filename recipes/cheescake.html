            <li>1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs (about 10 whole graham crackers)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>

        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 packages (8 oz each) cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
        </ul>

    <p></p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 325Â°F. Line 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking parchment paper, leaving enough hanging over sides to easily remove cheesecake from pan.</li>
                <p></p>
            <li>In small bowl, stir Crust ingredients until well mixed. Firmly press mixture in bottom of loaf pan.</li>
                <p></p>
            <li>In large bowl, beat cream cheese, 3/4 cup sugar, the flour and grated lemon zest with electric mixer on medium speed about 1 minute or until smooth.
                On low speed, beat in whipping cream, vanilla and eggs just until blended. Pour filling into crust, and smooth top.</li>
                <p></p>
            <li>Place loaf pan inside 13x9-inch baking pan.
                Pour very hot water into baking pan around loaf pan until water is about halfway up sides of filling in loaf pan, to create water bath.</li>
                <p></p>
            <li>Carefully place in oven. 
                Bake 55 to 65 minutes or until cheesecake is set at least 1 inch from long edge of pan but center of cheesecake still jiggles slightly when moved. 
                (Cheesecake will become firm during refrigeration.) Turn off oven; leave cheesecake in oven with door closed 15 minutes. 
                Carefully remove from oven; cool in pan (with water) on cooling rack 30 minutes. Remove pan from water bath.</li>
                <p></p>
            <li>
                Refrigerate about 3 hours, or until completely chilled. 
                Using parchment ends, carefully remove cheesecake from pan. 
                Carefully pull sides of parchment paper away from cheesecake. 
                To cut cheesecake, use long, thin-bladed, non-serrated knife. 
                Dip knife into hot water after each cut, cleaning off with paper towel. 
                Serve topped with your favorite toppings, if desired. 
                Store cheesecake loosely covered in refrigerator.</li>
        </ol>
